                        About me
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a recently graduated software engineering student from the University of Auckland. I am very enthusiastic 
                        about software development as I believe my passion for it stems from my love for complex problem solving, and I believe 
                        the diversity and constant evolution of software aligns with my eagerness to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A big stepping stone for my interest in software stems from my hobby of video games. As a kid, I enjoyed spending my time playing
                        games, which made me curious about how exactly these games are made. Thus, at a young age, I did some research on game development
                        and created some small simple games using a game development engine known as GameMaker. Succesfully executing my design and seeing it
                        work as desired was truly a satisfying experience. This idea of brainstorming possible solutions and finally overcoming the problem obstacle
                        is exactly what I love about software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, I still do a bit of game development on the side. However, I also try to incorporate my other hobbies such as chess into my personal projects.
                        An example of this is one of my current work-in-progress projects, where I am developing a Chess960 game but with a twist.

                    <p>
                        Ultimately, I would love to demonstrate my skills in an industrial environment, with an opportunity to broaden my skills and knowledge, 
                        and experience all the possiblities of modern software and technology.
